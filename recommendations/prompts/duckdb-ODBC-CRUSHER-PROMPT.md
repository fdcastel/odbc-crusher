# ODBC Crusher Analysis Prompt – duckdb

**Driver version**: `v1.4.4.0`
**Source code**: `tmp/external/duckdb-odbc` (checked out at tag `v1.4.4.0`)
**Reports**:
- `tmp/external/duckdb-odbc/crusher-report.txt`
- `tmp/external/duckdb-odbc/crusher-report.json`

## Instructions

Do a critical analysis of what `odbc-crusher` says about the `duckdb` driver and review its source code (at exactly this version) to see what the driver actually implements.

**GOAL:** For each **failed** or **skipped** test, investigate its result against the real `duckdb` sources:

1. **If the odbc-crusher report is CORRECT** (the driver really has the deficiency):
    - Write a recommendation in `recommendations/duckdb_ODBC_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` explaining what the `duckdb` developers should do to fix it.
    - Finish the recommendation with the following line: 
      ```

      ```

2. **If the odbc-crusher report is WRONG** (the driver is fine, odbc-crusher misjudged it):
    - Record it as a bug in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for future fix.
